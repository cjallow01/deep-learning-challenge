- **Summary**
In the three attempts I made, the model was unable to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 72.8%. Hypertuning resulted in virtually no improvement. I would consider using another classification model to see if it is better at predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
